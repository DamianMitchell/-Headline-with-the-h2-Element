Freecodecamp "Headline with the h2 Element"
<p>Over the next few challenges, we'll build an HTML5 app</p>
<p>The h2 element you enter will create an h2 element on the website.</p>
<p>This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different and new sections.</p>
<p>Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.</p>
<p>Create an h2 element.</br>
Make sure your h2 element has a closing tag.</br>
Your h2 element should have the text "CatPhotoApp".</br>
Your h1 element should have the text "Hello World"</p>
